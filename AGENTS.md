# Repository Guidelines

- Do **not** commit manual changes under `vendor/`. The vendored plugin snapshots are generated by automation; modify the source lists or scripts instead.
- When updating plugins, adjust the configuration in `nvim/lua/plugins/` or the manifest under `scripts/` and let the vendor sync scripts refresh plugin sources.
- Keep the working tree clean by running the documented checks before submitting changes.
